# SSL Checker Script

This repository contains a Python script that checks the OpenSSL version on your system and tests SSL/TLS connections to a user-provided website. The script is designed to identify whether the system is affected by CVE-2021-4044 and to test the handling of SSL errors during the connection process.

## Features

- **OpenSSL Version Check:** The script checks the version of OpenSSL installed on your system and alerts you if it is vulnerable to CVE-2021-4044.
- **SSL Connection Test:** It attempts to establish an SSL connection to a website provided by the user, handling and reporting any SSL errors that occur.
- **User Input:** The script prompts the user to input the target website URL for the SSL connection test.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x:** Ensure that you have Python 3 installed on your system.
- **Required Modules:** The script uses the following Python modules, which are part of the standard library:
  - `ssl`
  - `socket`
